        <p class="font1">You likely know of people who have been doing the same thing for years and seem to not have any
            problem staying stagnant. Whether it be in their marriage, job, or personal endeavors, they seem to be
            getting along just fine without progressing towards anything “better.”</p>
        <p class="font1">On the other hand, I’m sure you also know of individuals who focus on the positive, goals
            setting and are constantly pushing themselves to greater heights. Be it promotions at work, building a
            family, celebrating marriage milestones, traveling more, or going to school again, these individuals seem to
            constantly progress towards something that improves or enhances their life.

            So what’s the difference between these two types of individuals?

            What you feel capable of doing comes down to one thing: motivation. It’s the force, or lack of, that keeps
            driving you forward to overcome challenges and obstacles to achieve your goals.

            Without motivation, you’ll give up after a few failed attempts, or even on the first tough challenge that
            comes your way. Or you’ll just remain where you are: unhappy yet not doing anything to progress ahead.

            Whether you realize it or not, motivation is a huge force in your life, and it needs to be harnessed in
            order to excel and actually enjoy whatever it is that you’re doing on a daily basis. If you find yourself
            thinking, “I need motivation,” there are specific steps you can take.

            Unfortunately, many overgeneralize the word motivation. We think of being either motivated or unmotivated as
            a simple “yes” or “no” state of being.

            But motivation is not a switch. Motivation is a flow.

            The Motivation Flow
            To feel motivated, you need to dive beyond the surface. Just reading a motivational quote, being encouraged
            by your friends or mentor, or writing out a short to-do list won’t help you build sustainable motivation in
            the long run.

            You can think of the motivation that we want to achieve like the Sun (self-sustaining and long-lasting),
            which supplies a constant influx of energy to all life on Earth. Just like the Sun, your “motivation engine”
            has different layers, starting from the core and spreading out to the surface. The surface is what you see,
            but the real process is driven from the core (your internal motivation); and that’s the most important part.

            If you can create a self-sustaining motivation engine, you’ll be able to find more meaning in your life and
            enjoy every minute of what you’re doing, which will make your roles and responsibilities less of a chore..
        </p>
        <p class="font1">Having meaning is simple. If you want to learn how to find motivation, just ask yourself a question: Why?

            Why are you pursuing a certain goal? If the reason is vague or unclear, then your motivational energy will be the same. While motivation provides you energy to do something, that energy needs to be focused somewhere. So without meaning, there is no direction for your energy to focus.
            
            Yet, having a meaningful objective doesn’t mean you have to change the world or have a huge impact on society. The secret to meaningful work is simple: it should contribute value to something or someone that matters to you.
            
            One study suggested creativity as one possible path to meaning, saying: “Many of the core concepts in work on the meaning of life, such as the needs for coherence, significance, and purpose or the desire for symbolic immortality, can be reached through creative activity”[2].
            
            Next up is gaining forward movement. In short, this means to just keep moving. Like a snowball, motivation from having progress creates momentum. So to keep this up, you have to keep moving.
            
            The good news is, your progress doesn’t have to be huge for you to recognize it. Small amounts of progress can be just as motivating, as long as they keep coming. Like driving a car, you may be really impatient if you’re at a complete halt. But, it lessens if you’re moving forward, even if you’re moving slowly.
            
            Creating a simple progress indicator, like checklists or milestones, is a great way to visualize your small (and big) wins. They trigger your brain to recognize and acknowledge them, giving you small boosts of motivational energy.
            
            This is why video games are so addictive! They’re full of progress indicators everywhere. Even though the progress is completely virtual, they’re still able to trigger the motivation centers in your brain..</p>
        <p class="font1">The outermost layer, also known as Acknowledgement, encompasses any type of external recognition that might give you motivation. It may come in the form of respect or recognition, such as compliments and praise.

            Or it could be emotional support through encouragement, feedback, and constructive criticism. It could also be affiliation, where you have mutual companions or buddies sharing the same goal or burden with you.
            
            One recent study pointed out that “rewards had a positive impact on work motivation but no significant relationship existed between reward and job satisfaction”[1].
            
            Therefore, it’s important to recognize that rewards will motivate you, but they won’t necessarily make you happier in an undesirable situation.
            
            This is generally what you see on the surface when you look at other people. You see the external acknowledgement, respect, and recognition they’re getting.</p>
